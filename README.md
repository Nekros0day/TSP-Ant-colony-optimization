# TSP-Ant-colony-optimization
This repository contains a Python implementation of the Ant System (AS) algorithm for solving the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP). The Ant System is a probabilistic technique for solving computational problems which can be reduced to finding good paths through graphs, and it's particularly effective for the TSP.
